There are a lot of possible approaches to RabbitMQ clustering on
top of k8s. This post is about the clustering approach that was
adopted for Fuel CCP project. But most pitfals are common for all
approaches to RabbitMQ clustering, so first sections can be an
interesting read even if you want to come up with you own solution.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaab591d">
<p>
Running RubbitMQ cluster inside k8s poses a series of interesting
problems. The very first problem is what kind of names we should
use to make rabbits can see each other. Here are some examples of
such names in different form:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>rabbit@hostname</code></li>
<li><code>rabbit@hostname.domainname</code></li>
<li><code>rabbit@172.17.0.4</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
Even before trying to start any rabbits, you need to be sure that
containers can reach each other using selected naming scheme -
e.g. <code>ping</code> should work with the part that comes after the <code>@</code>.
</p>

<p>
Erlang distribution (which is actively used by RabbitMQ) can run
in one of two naming modes: short names or long names. Rule of
thumb is that it's long when it contains <code>.</code>, and short
otherwise. For name examples from above that means that the first
one is the short name, and the second and the third are the long
names.
</p>

<p>
Looking at all this we see that on k8s we have following options
for naming nodes:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use <a href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/petset/">PetSets</a> so we will have some stable DNS names</li>
<li>Use IP-addresses and some sort of automatic peer discovery (like
<a href="https://github.com/aweber/rabbitmq-autocluster/">autocluster plugin</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both this options require running in long-name mode, but the way
in which DNS/hostnames are configured inside k8s pods is
incompatible with RabbitMQ versions prior to 3.6.6 (<a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/890/">fix</a>).

<h3 id="orgc95a3df">Clustering gotchas</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc95a3df">
<p>
Another important things to know about RabbitMQ clusters is that
when a node joins to a cluster, its data will be lost no matter
what. It doesn't matter in the most common case - when it's the
empty node that is joining to the cluster, as we have nothing to
loose in this case. But if we had 2 nodes that operated
independently for some time and accumulated some data, there is no
way to join them without any losses (note that restoring a cluster
after network-split or node outage is just a special case of the
same thing, and also with data loss). For a specific workload you
can invent some workarounds, like draining (manually or
automatically) the nodes that are bound to be reset. But there is
just no way for making such solution robust, automatic and
universal.
</p>

<p>
So our choice of automatic clustering solution is heavily
influenced by what kinds of data losses we can tolerate for our
concrete workloads.
</p>

<h3 id="org4df18d3">Cluster formation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4df18d3">
<p>
Assuming that you've solved all naming-related problems and can
cluster your rabbits manually using <code>rabbitmqctl</code>, it's time to
make our cluster assembly automatic. But as we seen in the
previous section, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for that
problem.
</p>

<p>
One such very specific solution is described further. It's only
suitable for workloads where we don't care if some data is lost
along with a server that went down or got disconnected. An
example of such workload is doing RPC, where clients just retry
their (preferably idempotent) requests after any
error/timeout. Because by the time a server recovers from a
failure, RPC request will be stale and no longer relevant. And
this is exactly what's happening with RPC calls performed by
various components of OpenStack.
</p>

<p>
Bearing all of the above in mind, we can start desiging our
solution. The less state the better, so using IP-addresses is
preferable to using PetSets. And the <a href="http://aweber.github.io/rabbitmq-autocluster/">autocluster</a> plugin is our
obvious candidate for forming a cluster from a bunch of dynamic
disposable nodes.
</p>

<p>
Going through <a href="https://github.com/aweber/rabbitmq-autocluster/wiki/General%20Settings">autocluster documentation</a> we end setting the
following configuration options:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>{backend, etcd}</code> - it's almost arbitary choice, <code>consul</code> or
<code>k8s</code> would've worked as well. The only reason for choosing it
was that it's easier to test - you can download <code>etcd</code> binary,
run it without any parameters and just start forming clusters on
localhost.</li>
<li><code>{autocluster_failure, stop}</code> - pod that failed to join to
cluster is useless for us, so bail out and hope that next
restart will happen in a more friendly environment</li>
<li><code>{cluster_cleanup, true}</code>, <code>{cleanup_interval, 30}</code>,
<code>{cleanup_warn_only, false}</code>, <code>{etcd_ttl, 15}</code>. Node is
registered in etcd only after it's successfully joined cluster
and fully started up. This registration TTL is constantly
updated while the node is alive. If the node dies (or fails to
update TTL in any other way), it's forcefully kicked from the
cluster. So even if the failed node will be restarted with the
same IP, it'll be able to join cluster afresh.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="orgd0209a9">Unexpected races</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd0209a9">
<p>
If you've tried assembling a cluster several times with the config
from above, you could've noticed that sometimes it can assemble
several different unconnected clusters. This happens because the
only protection against startup races in autocluster is some
random delay during node startup - and with a very bad timing
every node can decide that it is the first node (i.e. there is no
other records in etcd) and just start in unclustered mode.
</p>

<p>
This problem lead to the developement of a pretty big <a href="https://github.com/aweber/rabbitmq-autocluster/pull/98">patch</a> for
autocluster. It adds proper startup locking - node acquires
startup lock early in startup, and releases it only after it had
properly registered itself in backend. Only <code>etcd</code> backend is
supported at the moment, but others can be added easily (by
implementing just 2 new callbacks in backend module).
</p>

<p>
Another solution to that problem are k8s PetSets, as they can
perform startup orchestration - with only one node performing
startup at any given time. But they are currently considered alpha
feature. And the patch above provides provides this functionality
for everyone, not only for k8s users.

<h3 id="orga12b398">Monitoring</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga12b398">
<p>
The only thing left to make our cluster run unattended is adding
some monitoring. We need to monitor both rabbit's health and
whether it's properly clustered with the rest of nodes.
</p>

<p>
You may remember the times when <code>rabbitmqctl list_queues</code> /
<code>rabbitmqctl list_channels</code> was used as a method of
monitoring. But it's a very bad method: it can't distinguish local
and remote problems and it creates significant network load. Meet
the new and shiny <code>rabbitmqctl node_health_check</code> - since <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/818">3.6.4</a>
it's the best way to check the health of any single RabbitMQ node.
</p>

<p>
Checking whether node is properly clustered requires several checks:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it is clustered with the best node registered in autocluster
backend (i.e. the node that new nodes will attempt to join to,
currently it is first alive node in alphabetical order)</li>
<li>even when node is properly clustered with the discovery node,
it's data can still be diverged. And this check is not
transitive, so we need to check partitions list both on the
current node and on the discovery node.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All this clustering checks are implemented in separate <a href="https://github.com/Mirantis/rabbitmq-autocluster/commit/5fee57752a0788bd2358d3f09eae76d4da67f039">commit</a> and
can be invoked using:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-erlang">rabbitmqctl eval <span style="color: #CC9393;">'autocluster:cluster_health_check_report().'</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using both this <code>rabbitmqctl</code> command we can detect any problem with
our rabbit node and stop it immediately, so k8s will have a chance
to do its restarting magic.

<p>
If you want to replicate such setup yourself, you'll need a recent
version of <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/rabbitmq_v3_6_6">RabbitMQ</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Mirantis/rabbitmq-autocluster/releases/tag/0.6.1.950">the custom release of the autocluster
plugin</a> (as the startup locking patch is not yet accepted
upstream).
</p>

<p>
You can also look into <a href="https://github.com/openstack/fuel-ccp-rabbitmq/tree/master/service/files">exact code and config files</a> that are used
by Fuel CCP, they should be pretty self explanatory.
